# Feral Friends - Incremental Game Development Plan

## Project Overview
A mobile-first, offline-capable, turn-based 2D top-down game inspired by classic Game Boy Advance Pokémon games. Players discover, befriend, and compete with feral animals through tricks and taming rather than combat.

## Development Philosophy
**Incremental Development Approach:**
- Start with a polished homepage and basic UI foundation
- Build core systems incrementally, testing each addition thoroughly
- Prioritize user experience and mobile responsiveness from day one

- Styled Components (Component styling)

**Dependencies to Add Incrementally:**
- Zustand (State management - Stage 2)
- React Spring (Animations - Stage 4)
- Canvas/CSS-based rendering (Stage 3)
- @tanstack/react-query (Data management - Stage 5)
- Workbox (PWA features - Stage 6)

### Development Workflow
**Daily Process:**
```
1. Morning: Review previous day's progress, test on mobile device
2. Development: Focus on one feature/component at a time
3. Testing: Continuously test on mobile throughout development
4. Evening: Commit progress, update documentation, plan next day
```

**Weekly Reviews:**
- Monday: Plan week's goals, prioritize features
- Wednesday: Mid-week progress check, adjust scope if needed
- Friday: Week review, test full functionality, gather feedback

**Quality Assurance:**
```
PROMPT QA.1: "After each stage, run comprehensive testing checklist: mobile responsiveness, touch interactions, performance on lower-end devices, accessibility compliance, and user experience flow."

PROMPT QA.2: "Set up automated testing pipeline with Playwright for mobile testing. Include: touch gesture simulation, performance monitoring, screenshot testing across devices, and accessibility auditing."

PROMPT QA.3: "Create user testing protocol for each stage. Include: usability testing with real users, feedback collection system, iteration based on user input, and documentation of UX improvements."
```

## Next Steps

**To Begin Development:**
1. Start with PROMPT 1.1.1 to create the homepage
2. Complete Stage 1 entirely before moving to Stage 2
3. Test each feature thoroughly on mobile devices
4. Gather user feedback early and often
5. Maintain focus on mobile-first, incremental development

**Key Success Factors:**
- Never skip testing on actual mobile devices
- Keep each stage focused and achievable
- Prioritize user experience over feature complexity
- Build solid foundations before adding advanced features
- Maintain consistent development velocity

This incremental approach ensures a polished, mobile-optimized game that grows systematically from a strong foundation into a rich, engaging experience.
